# Forge schedule: the machine's cadence for a forge. One pass runs the stall
# watch over every forge root it serves, and then a doorbell pass for each root,
# so a request that never reached its role is rung with nobody asking.
#
# The tools stay separate and so do their rules: the watch notices a role that
# holds work and is not moving, and the doorbell notices a message the operator
# sent that never arrived. This script is only the cadence - what the machine
# runs on a timer, and the evidence that it ran.
#
# Usage:
#   forge_schedule.sh run <forge-root>...
#
# Every pass runs even when another fails, so a broken one cannot take the rest
# down; a root that cannot be served is named rather than skipped in silence;
# and the heartbeat and the log live in the first root, which is where the
# agent that runs this was installed from.
#
# The cadence is also the only thing that runs whether or not a session is up, so
# it is what cleans up after the forge: the forge's own scratch is swept by age -
# untouched since, not a name pattern, because the honest question about what a
# failed run left is whether anyone is still looking at it - and its own log is
# kept a day to a file, because age cannot judge a file this writes every minute.
# The projects take the second half through the layer's own pruner, once a day
# and only when the forge carries it: the pass brings the cadence, not the policy.
